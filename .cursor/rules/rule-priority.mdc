# Rule Priority

Before making changes, check for applicable project rules and follow the most specific ones first.

- Prioritize file-matched rules (for example, Rust rules on `**/*.rs`) over generic guidance.
- When multiple rules apply, follow the stricter/more specific rule first, then the general rule.
- Do not proceed with implementation that conflicts with an applicable rule.
- If rules are ambiguous or conflict, ask the user which rule should take priority before continuing.

## Current project note

- For Rust files, follow the Rust pattern-consistency rule and preserve existing project patterns.
